## This is my portfolio

This website is built with NextJS, and currently deployed to Vercel. It also uses StoryBlok for its blog, ChakraUI for some components and Firebase for the views and likes of the blog posts.

I'm also using Spotify's API to display the artist I last listened to and GIPHY's SDK to allow users to send me a GIF hehe
